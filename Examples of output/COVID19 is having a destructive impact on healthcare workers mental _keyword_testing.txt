COVID19 is having a destructive impact on healthcare workers mental 
wellbeing



BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may aggravate workplace 
conditions that impact health-care workers' mental health. However, it can also 
place other stresses on workers outside of their work. This study determines the 
effect of COVID-19 on symptoms of negative and positive mental health and the 
workforce's experience with various sources of support. Effect modification by 
demographic variables was also studied.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study, conducted between 2 April and 4 May 
2020 (two waves), led to a convenience sample of 4509 health-care workers in 
Flanders (Belgium), including paramedics (40.6%), nurses (33.4%), doctors 
(13.4%) and management staff (12.2%). About three in four were employed in 
university and acute hospitals (29.6%), primary care practices (25.7%), 
residential care centers (21.3%) or care sites for disabled and mental health 
care. In each of the two waves, participants were asked how frequently (on a 
scale of 0-10) they experienced positive and negative mental health symptoms 
during normal circumstances and during last week, referred to as before and 
during COVID-19, respectively. These symptoms were stress, hypervigilance, 
fatigue, difficulty sleeping, unable to relax, fear, irregular lifestyle, 
flashback, difficulty concentrating, feeling unhappy and dejected, failing to 
recognize their own emotional response, doubting knowledge and skills and 
feeling uncomfortable within the team. Associations between COVID-19 and mental 
health symptoms were estimated by cumulative logit models and reported as odds 
ratios. The needed support was our secondary outcome and was reported as the 
degree to which health-care workers relied on sources of support and how they 
experienced them.
RESULTS: All symptoms were significantly more pronounced during versus before 
COVID-19. For hypervigilance, there was a 12-fold odds (odds ratio 12.24, 95% 
confidence interval 11.11-13.49) during versus before COVID-19. Positive 
professional symptoms such as the feeling that one can make a difference were 
less frequently experienced. The association between COVID-19 and mental health 
was generally strongest for the age group 30-49 years, females, nurses and 
residential care centers. Health-care workers reported to rely on support from 
relatives and peers. A considerable proportion, respectively, 18 and 27%, 
reported the need for professional guidance from psychologists and more support 
from their leadership.
CONCLUSIONS: The toll of the crisis has been heavy on health-care workers. Those 
who carry leadership positions at an organizational or system level should take 
this opportunity to develop targeted strategies to mitigate key stressors of 
health-care workers' mental well-being.
