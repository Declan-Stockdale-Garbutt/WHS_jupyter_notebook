Issues and Solutions in Mental Health and Work Managers Perspectives of a 
Large Health Organization



Mental health problems in the workplace represent an important issue for public 
organizations, particularly for people working in the health sector who have 
been confronted to multiple changes following the recent health system reform in 
Quebec. Managers need to take into consideration employee mental health within 
their organization in order to ensure productive and healthy employees. Managers 
are thus called upon to take on a role that includes prevention (e.g., detection 
of early warning signs), team management (e.g., working on recognition at work) 
and coaching employees in their tasks when returning to work following a sick 
leave due to a common mental disorder (e.g., depression). Although there is an 
abundant literature on the manager's role in the prevention of mental health 
problems in the workplace and the work rehabilitation of employees on sick leave 
due to a common mental disorder, to our knowledge, little research has been 
conducted on these issues regarding managers' perceptions working in large 
health organizations. Furthermore, potential solutions have not been explored in 
this context. Objective The purpose of the study is to document, from the 
managers' perspective within a large health organization in Quebec, the issues 
pertaining to mental health and work (from prevention to work rehabilitation), 
and the solutions to deal with them. Method As part of a participatory research 
project, researchers and collaborators of a large health organization conducted 
focus groups with managers on the theme of mental health and work: issues and 
solutions. A total of 83 managers spread out in 10 focus groups participated in 
this study. Results From these focus groups, 6 broad categories of issues 
related to mental health in the workplace emerged: 1) the management framework, 
2) human, financial, material and information resource management, 3) management 
of mental health and tools, 4), stakeholders' collaboration, roles and actions, 
5) employees' sense of belonging to the organization and, 6) work-life balance. 
From these broad conceptual categories, 23 specific issues and associated 
solutions emerged. Conclusions From this study, the general consensus was the 
need to have access to a series of tools (e.g., toolbox) in order to assist 
managers across the different steps, from sick-leave prevention, to 
rehabilitation and return to work. The results also highlighted the need to 
better define the roles of each stakeholder in this process. These results bring 
a new light to the issues and potential solutions perceived by managers dealing 
with mental health and work issues in a large health organization. These results 
could eventually be replicated in other settings or large organizations.
